# Changelog

## [1.0.0]

This is first version of DTO Mapper, corrected bugs and added some new features.
If you were using previous versions 0.*, please update your code to use 1.0.*.

Known BC breaks:
- MapFrom and MapTo attributes were renamed to From and To.
- MapFrom and MapTo attributes have member and getter/setter names as parameters instead of just member name.
- Transformers are now having reversed transform() and reverse() methods, and it's controllable by providing
`reverse` parameter in attribute.
